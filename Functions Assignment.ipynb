What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n","\n","Ans. In  Python, Functions are independent blocks of code that can be called from anywhere, while methods are tied to objects or classes and need an object or class instance to be invoked.\n","Example: A function to calculate the sum of two numbers can be used in different parts of a program without needing an object or class whereas A method in a class called \"Customer\" might be used to update the customer's address or check their purchase history."],"metadata":{"id":"sFwsoyR2oPI8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n","\n","Ans. Functions can receive inputs, allowing them to operate on different data each time they are called. These inputs are defined using parameters and arguments.\n","Parameters are variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition\n","Arguements are the actual values passed to the function when it is called."],"metadata":{"id":"ZYZPNoyKo9bH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n","\n","Ans. Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses for parameters, and a colon. The function body is indented below.\n","Different ways to define functions are as follows :\n","a.  Standard Functions: Use the def keyword followed by the function name, parameters in parentheses, and a colon.\n","b.  Lambda Functions: Create anonymous, single-expression functions using the lambda keyword.\n","c.  Generator Functions: Defined using def and the yield keyword, these functions return iterators.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"iaiZ5xMqp0ri"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q4. What is the purpose of the 'return' statement in a Python function?\n","\n","Ans. A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and it \"returns\" the value of the expression following the return keyword to the caller. The statements after the return statements are not executed."],"metadata":{"id":"BIUsmKp9rPPl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","\n","Ans. Iterable is an object, that one can iterate over. It generates an Iterator when passed to iter() method. An iterator is an object, which is used to iterate over an iterable object using the __next__() method."],"metadata":{"id":"Ms4pToDerhM9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n","\n","Ans. A generator function is a special type of function that returns an iterator object. Instead of using return to send back a single value, generator functions use yield to produce a series of results over time. This allows the function to generate values and pause its execution after each yield, maintaining its state between iterations."],"metadata":{"id":"LoSELXRTs_Rv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","\n","Ans. A normal function creates an entire sequence in memory to return a sequence from the list. If the number of items in the sequence is large, it can consume ample memory. However, a generator function is memory-friendly as it calculates the value and produces one item at a time."],"metadata":{"id":"g7cU-tkstqXf"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n","\n","Ans. A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. It's typically used for short, simple operations and is often employed when a regular function definition would be too verbose or unnecessary, like when passing a function as an argument to another function."],"metadata":{"id":"-ANv7sSsuSUL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n","\n","Ans. The map() function in Python is a built-in function that applies a given function to each item of an iterable (e.g., list, tuple, set) and returns a map object, which is an iterator. This allows you to transform or modify the elements of an iterable without using explicit loops, leading to more concise and readable code."],"metadata":{"id":"9fn6d3jpu5qa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n","\n","Ans. The map function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple, etc.)\n","The reduce function is used to apply a particular function passed in its argument to all of the list elements mentioned in the sequence passed along.This function is defined in “functools” module.\n","The filter method filters the given sequence with the help of a function that tests each element in the sequence to be true or not.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"L2CzFI5zvJME"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q11.
