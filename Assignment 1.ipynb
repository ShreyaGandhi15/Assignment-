What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n","\n","Ans. Python is a programming language that is interpretedobject-oriented, and considered to be high-level.\n","python is popular because of following reasons:\n","a. Readability and Simplicity\n","b. Versatility\n","c. Extensive Libraries i.e it has lot many libraries.\n","d. Large and Active Community\n","e. Open source and is free.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MDLQj88tSGF9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","Ans. Interpreters are the computer program that will convert the source code or an high level language into intermediate code. It is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line."],"metadata":{"id":"bc_0sOn7US4r"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","Ams. Keywords in Python are predefined which is also known as reserved words used in Python programming that have special meanings to the compiler.

And if attempted to use them as variable name would result in a SyntaxError."],"metadata":{"id":"WE5fpP5PWnah"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5. What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","Ans. Mutability in python has the ability of objects to change their values. Python's mutable objects are lists and dictionaries which allows to change the data without changing their identity."],"metadata":{"id":"uX-otEJxXRoT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","Ans. Python lists are mutableas they allow you to change, add, or remove elements whereas tuples are immutable as they can not be changed after creation of their content."],"metadata":{"id":"lATu_ADSZ_hz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","\n","Ans. In Python, \"==\" is known as Equality Operator and \"is\" is known as identity operator.

It determines if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory."],"metadata":{"id":"-wkkljoSpNXL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","Ans. Python logical operators are used to combine conditional statements, allowing you to perform operations based on multiple conditions.\n","Example: \"AND\", \"OR\" and \"NOT\"."],"metadata":{"id":"b7XKTzjPq0TI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9. What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","Ans.Type Casting is the method to convert the Python variable datatype into a certain data type in order to perform the required operation by users.

What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","Ans. In implicit type casting, the programming language automatically converts data from one type to another if needed. For example, if you have an integer variable and you try to assign it to a float variable, the programming language will automatically convert the integer to a float without you having to do anything. Whereas in Explicit type casting occurs when the programmer explicitly converts a value from one data type to another. Unlike implicit type casting, explicit type casting requires the programmer to specify the desired data type conversion."],"metadata":{"id":"Je0bJf3guAgf"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11.

How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","Ans. The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions.

The exact number of iterations isn't known beforehand.\n","Scenario: Imagine a situation where you are reading data from a file until you reach the end. You don't know how many lines the file contains, so you need a loop that keeps reading line by line until there are no more lines to read. In such a case, a \"While Loop\" is more appropriate because the number of iterations needed isn't known in advance—it depends on the file's content."],"metadata":{"id":"3I_2E3y_xzf3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Question\n"],"metadata":{"id":"CfhLVCNJ0XD4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
